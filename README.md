# NuclearCraft (it will change name)
A minecraft plugin that adds the power and the dangers of nuclear energy.


# NOTICE
The development of this plugin is still on my plans but lately I'm being very busy. However I'm still thinking about features and I have all the implementations in mind, I just need time.
